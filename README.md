# architectureApp

This GitHub repo is for creating an IOS application to give information about different architectural styles and where they can be found worldwide. There will be images to show what the key features are for certain types. Citations for where I got information from, both for learning Swift as well as about the different historical architectural styles.

This will be created on a Windows machine with using Visual Studio as the IDE. In order to make it go on the Apple app store, it will need to be created on Xcode which is the IDE specifically for IOS.
